# 🪨📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors (GUI Edition)

A modern, interactive version of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game, built with a clean graphical user interface.

## 📌 Project Description

This project has evolved from a console-based script to a fully interactive web application. The game features:

- **Event-Driven Gameplay:** No more typing! Play by clicking interactive buttons.
- **Real-time Scoreboard:** The score updates instantly on the screen as you play.
- **First to Five:** The game automatically tracks progress and announces a winner once a player reaches 5 points.
- **Modern UI:** A clean, responsive design with hover effects and a "Play Again" reset feature.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Semantic structure for the game interface.
- **CSS3:** Modern styling using Flexbox, custom properties (variables), and transitions.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla):** DOM manipulation, event listeners, and game logic.
